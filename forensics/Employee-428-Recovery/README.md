## Description:

This is the story of Employee 428

Employee 428 also loves their job, very much.

Then one day, something strange happens

Something Employee 428 would never forget

The master password list that Employee 428 had been entrusted to keep was deleted

Employee 428 was shocked, what could have happened? They thought to themself

But it's ok! Since Employee 428 is a respectable employee that always makes backups of important files

...

...

Wait what? Your're telling me there's no backup? THEY were the only one with the file?

How could any company be this stupid?

Employee 428 I will be real with you we really need to carve up an idea up here because frankly, I'm lost. I can't possibly think of any way to recover this.
