Challenge Name: "Steganography Maze"

Challenge Description: In this challenge, participants are provided with a PNG image file that has been hidden using steganography. The image appears to be a colorful abstract pattern, but it actually contains a hidden message. The participants need to use Stegsolve tool to analyze the image and find the hidden message.

Challenge Objective: The objective of this challenge is to test participants' steganography analysis skills, including their ability to identify and extract hidden data from images using Stegsolve.

Challenge Solution: The participants need to use Stegsolve tool to analyze the PNG image. The Stegsolve tool provides different options to view the image data, including color channels, bit planes, and ASCII representation. Participants can start by trying different color channels (such as red, green, and blue) to see if any hidden data is revealed. They can also try viewing the image in different bit planes (such as the least significant bit plane) to see if any data is hidden there. Additionally, participants can try converting the image to ASCII representation to see if any text is hidden in the image.

Hints: To make the challenge more guessy, the image can have multiple layers of hidden data, and participants may need to try multiple Stegsolve options to reveal each layer. The hidden message can also be encoded using different techniques, such as binary or hexadecimal encoding, which participants may need to guess and decode to reveal the message.

Difficulty Level: This challenge can be classified as a beginner to intermediate difficulty level, as it relies heavily on guesswork and experimentation with Stegsolve options. However, the challenge can be made more difficult by adding multiple layers of hidden data and encoding techniques.
