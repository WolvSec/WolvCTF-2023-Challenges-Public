In the world of code and tech,
Where programmers seek to flex,
There lies a game of wit and skill,
A challenge to test their will.

CTF, the competition grand,
A battlefield of bytes and command,
Where teams of coders come to vie,
For glory and the ultimate prize.

They gather 'round their screens so bright,
Fingers poised to take on the fight,
Against each other they'll compete,
To see who's code reigns supreme.

From web exploits to reverse eng,
To crypto puzzles and more within,
They must decipher each clue and hint,
To claim their place atop the sprint.

And as the clock ticks down the time,
They race to solve each challenge line,
With every code and keystroke spent,
They strive to emerge triumphant.

For those who win, the joy is sweet,
Their skills and knowledge on full display,
And though the challenges may be steep,
They'll always come back for more, each day.

So let us raise a toast and cheer,
To those who compete without fear,
In the world of code and tech,
And to CTF, the competition that we love and respect.
