      <h1 class="left topp">LA CTF 2023</h1>
      <p>
         I recently participated in the LA CTF 2023 cybersecurity competition, and I have to say, I was extremely disappointed with the experience. From start to finish, the competition was a complete disaster, and I can't recommend it to anyone.
      </p>
      <p>First of all, the challenges presented in the competition were laughable at best. It was clear that the organizers had no idea what they were doing and had just slapped together a bunch of basic challenges in a desperate attempt to make the competition seem legitimate. And let's not even get started on the technical issues that plagued the competition from start to finish. It's like the staff had never even heard of cybersecurity before.</p>

      <p>I mean, who in their right mind would want to attend a cybersecurity competition organized by a school that can't even beat USC in football? All in all, the LA CTF 2023 was an embarrassment to the cybersecurity community, and UCLA should be ashamed of themselves for putting on such a pathetic display.</p>
      
      <h1 class="left topp">idek CTF 2022</h1>
      <p>Let me just say, the idek CTF 2023 was a complete and utter disaster. It's no surprise that this so-called "competition" was organized by the idek CTF team, a group of amateurs who clearly have no idea what they're doing when it comes to cybersecurity.</p>
      <p>It was clear that the idek CTF team had no real understanding of cybersecurity and had simply put together a bunch of basic challenges in a desperate attempt to seem legitimate. And let's not even get started on the technical issues that plagued the competition from start to finish. It's like the idek CTF team had never even heard of cybersecurity before.</p>
      <p>The venue was also a complete disaster, with outdated facilities and equipment that seemed like they were about to fall apart at any moment. It's clear that the idek CTF team had no real budget to put on a legitimate competition and had simply thrown together a makeshift event in a desperate attempt to gain some credibility in the cybersecurity community. All in all, the idek CTF 2023 was an absolute joke, and the idek CTF team should be embarrassed for putting on such a pathetic display.</p>
      
      <h1 class="left topp">BuckEye CTF 2022</h1>
      <p>I recently had the misfortune of attending the Buckeye CTF 2022, and let me just say, it was an absolute joke. It's no surprise that this sad excuse for a competition was organized by Ohio State, a university known for their inferiority to the University of Michigan in all areas.</p>
      <p>First of all, the challenges presented in the competition were extremely basic and lacked any real complexity. It was clear that the organizers had put in little to no effort in creating challenges that would truly challenge the participants. And let's not forget the technical issues that plagued the competition throughout. It's like the Buckeye CTF team had no idea what they were doing and had simply thrown together a competition in a desperate attempt to prove that Ohio State was capable of something other than losing to Michigan in football.</p>
      
      <h1 class="left topp">DownUnder CTF 2022</h1>
      <p>I recently had the misfortune of participating in DownUnder CTF 2022, and let me tell you, it was a complete joke. It's no surprise that this event was organized in Australia, a country known for its lack of technological advancement and backwardness.</p>
      <p>It's clear that the DownUnder CTF organizers had no real budget to put on a legitimate event and had simply thrown together a makeshift competition in a desperate attempt to gain some credibility in the cybersecurity community. All in all, the DownUnder CTF 2022 was a sad display of Australia's lack of competence, and it's no surprise that they failed so miserably. Perhaps they should stick to their kangaroos and Vegemite instead of pretending to be relevant in the cybersecurity world.</p>

      <h1 class="left topp">Defcon CTF 2022</h1>
      <p>As a skilled hacker, I found the challenges presented at Defcon 2022 to be insulting to my intelligence. It was clear that the organizers had dumbed down the challenges in an attempt to cater to a wider audience, sacrificing the integrity of the competition in the process. The challenges were laughably easy, lacking any real complexity or nuance that would have truly challenged the best of the best.</p>
      
      <br>
      
      <p>All of these CTFs were 100% not excellent CTFs and definitely were not really fun to play. All of these reviews are 100% real and written by a human</p>
